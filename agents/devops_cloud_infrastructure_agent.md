---

## CONTENT STRUCTURE FRAMEWORK

### 1. CONTEXT & PROBLEM STATEMENT (10-15% of content)

**What to Include:**
- Real-world problem this solves
- Why traditional approaches fail
- Impact on business metrics (deployment frequency, MTTR, etc.)
- Common pain points engineers face
- Cost implications of the problem
- Compliance or security drivers (if applicable)

**Example Opening:**
```
Manual deployments cost the average engineering team 23 hours per week—time 
that could be spent building features. Worse, manual processes introduce 
human error, causing 67% of production incidents according to the 2024 
State of DevOps Report. This guide demonstrates how to build a fully 
automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that reduces deployment time 
from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes while improving success rates from 73% 
to 98.5%.
```

### 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE (20-25% of content)

**High-Level Design:**
- Architecture diagram description (or ASCII art)
- Component breakdown with responsibilities
- Data flow and interaction patterns
- Integration points with existing systems
- Network topology

**Design Decisions:**
- Why this architecture over alternatives
- Trade-offs explicitly stated
- Scalability considerations
- Cost implications
- Failure modes and handling

**Example Structure:**
```
## Architecture Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of five core components:

1. **Source Control** (GitHub): 
   - Trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches
   - Branch protection requiring PR reviews and passing checks
   - Semantic versioning with automated tagging

2. **CI Pipeline** (GitHub Actions):
   - Parallel test execution across multiple Node.js versions
   - Docker multi-stage builds with layer caching
   - Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk, CodeQL)
   - Artifact storage in GitHub Packages

3. **Deployment Engine** (ArgoCD):
   - GitOps-based deployment from manifest repository
   - Automated sync with health checks
   - Rollback capability with zero-downtime

4. **Target Infrastructure** (AWS EKS):
   - Multi-AZ Kubernetes cluster
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
   - Network policies for isolation

5. **Observability** (Prometheus + Grafana):
   - Golden signals monitoring (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
   - Custom business metrics
   - Alerting to PagerDuty and Slack

### Design Trade-offs

We chose GitHub Actions over Jenkins because:
- ✅ Zero infrastructure maintenance
- ✅ Native GitHub integration (no webhook complexity)
- ✅ 2,000 free minutes/month for private repos
- ❌ Slightly less flexibility than Jenkins for complex workflows
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to GitHub (mitigated by standardized YAML)

We selected ArgoCD for GitOps because:
- ✅ Declarative, version-controlled deployments
- ✅ Automatic drift detection and correction
- ✅ Superior audit trail compared to kubectl apply
- ❌ Learning curve for teams new to GitOps
- ❌ Additional component to maintain
```

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION (40-50% of content)

**Three-Tier Approach:**

#### LEVEL 1: Basic Implementation (Foundation)
- Single environment (typically dev)
- Core functionality only
- Simplified configuration
- 50-150 lines of code
- **Goal**: Get something working quickly to understand concepts

**Example:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/basic-ci.yml
name: Basic CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

#### LEVEL 2: Intermediate Implementation (Production-Ready)
- Multi-environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Proper secrets management
- Error handling and retries
- Basic monitoring
- Security scanning
- 200-400 lines of code
- **Goal**: What most teams should implement

**Example:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/production-ci-cd.yml
name: Production CI/CD

- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data (never hardcode)
- ✅ Implement secret rotation policies (90-day maximum)
- ✅ Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication (no long-lived credentials)
- ✅ Scope secrets to specific environments
- ✅ Audit secret access regularly
- ✅ Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for runtime secrets

### Container Security
- ✅ Use specific image tags (never :latest in production)
- ✅ Run containers as non-root user
- ✅ Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk)
- ✅ Sign images with Cosign
- ✅ Use minimal base images (Alpine, Distroless)
- ✅ Enable Docker Content Trust
- ✅ Implement image retention policies

### Pipeline Security
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merge
- ✅ Enable branch protection rules
- ✅ Use CODEOWNERS for critical paths
- ✅ Implement required status checks
- ✅ Use environment protection rules for production
- ✅ Enable audit logging
- ✅ Review third-party actions (pin to specific commits)

### Network Security
- ✅ Implement Network Policies in Kubernetes
- ✅ Use private subnets for compute resources
- ✅ Enable VPC Flow Logs
- ✅ Implement WAF rules
- ✅ Use private endpoints for services
- ✅ Enable encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```
## Performance Best Practices

### Build Optimization
- Use Docker layer caching effectively
- Implement multi-stage builds
- Parallelize test execution
- Use build caching (GitHub Actions cache, BuildKit)
- Optimize dependency installation (npm ci vs npm install)

### Deployment Optimization
- Implement rolling updates with proper health checks
- Use liveness and readiness probes
- Configure appropriate resource requests and limits
- Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Use pod disruption budgets
- Implement connection pooling for databases

### Monitoring Optimization
- Define SLIs and SLOs for each service
- Implement golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- Use distributed tracing for complex flows
- Set up proper log aggregation
- Create actionable alerts (not noise)
- Implement runbooks for common issues
```

**Cost Optimization:**
```
## Cost Management Strategies

### Compute Costs
- Right-size instances based on actual usage
- Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads
- Implement autoscaling based on metrics
- Schedule non-production environments (shut down nights/weekends)
- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Consider Fargate/Cloud Run for variable workloads

### Storage Costs
- Implement lifecycle policies (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
- Clean up old artifacts and images
- Use compression for logs and backups
- Archive infrequently accessed data
- Delete unused snapshots and volumes

### Network Costs
- Use VPC endpoints to avoid NAT gateway charges
- Implement CloudFront/CDN for static assets
- Minimize cross-region data transfer
- Use VPC peering instead of VPN where possible

### Monitoring Costs
- Set log retention policies
- Sample metrics strategically
- Use metric filters to reduce cardinality
- Archive old monitoring data to cold storage
```

**Disaster Recovery:**
```
## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Backup Strategy
- Automated daily backups to separate region
- Backup verification testing (monthly)
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup encryption enabled
- 30-day retention minimum

### Rollback Procedures
1. Identify issue through monitoring/alerts
2. Stop ongoing deployment immediately
3. Initiate rollback to last known good version
4. Verify rollback success through smoke tests
5. Investigate root cause
6. Create post-mortem document

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Critical services: < 5 minutes
- Important services: < 30 minutes
- Non-critical services: < 4 hours

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Database: < 5 minutes data loss acceptable
- Application state: < 1 minute
- Configuration: Zero loss (version controlled)
```

### 5. TROUBLESHOOTING & COMMON PITFALLS (5-10% of content)

**Format:**
```
## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Pipeline Fails with "Error: Process completed with exit code 1"

**Symptom:**
Build step fails without clear error message.

**Possible Causes:**
- Dependency installation failure
- Test failures being swallowed
- Insufficient permissions
- Resource limits exceeded

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Enable debug logging:
   ```yaml
   - name: Enable debug
     run: echo "ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
   ```

2. Check for hidden test failures:
   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests with verbose output
     run: npm test -- --verbose
   ```

3. Verify resource limits:
   ```yaml
   - name: Check resources
     run: |
       echo "CPU cores: $(nproc)"
       echo "Memory: $(free -h)"
       echo "Disk: $(df -h)"
   ```

**Solution:**
Add explicit error handling and logging at each step.

---

### Issue 2: Docker Build Fails with "No space left on device"

**Symptom:**
Build fails during image layer creation.

**Root Cause:**
GitHub Actions runners have limited disk space (14GB for ubuntu-latest).

**Solution:**
1. Clean up before build:
   ```yaml
   - name: Free disk space
     run: |
       sudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet
       sudo rm -rf /opt/ghc
       sudo rm -rf "/usr/local/share/boost"
       sudo rm -rf "$AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY"
       docker system prune -af
   ```

2. Use multi-stage builds to reduce layer size
3. Optimize .dockerignore file
4. Consider self-hosted runners with more disk space

---

### Issue 3: Kubernetes Deployment Stuck in "ImagePullBackOff"

**Symptom:**
Pods fail to start, stuck pulling container image.

**Debugging:**
```bash
# Check pod events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Check image name
kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml | grep image:

# Test image pull manually
docker pull <image-name>
```

**Common Causes:**
1. **Wrong image name/tag**: Verify image exists in registry
2. **Authentication issues**: Check imagePullSecrets
3. **Rate limiting**: Implement registry mirror or authentication
4. **Network policies**: Verify egress rules allow registry access

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Add imagePullSecrets to deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: registry-credentials
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: ghcr.io/org/app:v1.2.3
```
```

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### GitHub Actions Content Must Include:
- Workflow YAML with proper triggers
- Permissions block (principle of least privilege)
- Reusable workflow examples where appropriate
- Matrix strategy for multi-version testing
- Caching configuration for speed
- Security scanning integration
- Environment protection rules for production
- Self-hosted runner considerations

### Azure DevOps Content Must Include:
- YAML pipeline (not classic)
- Multi-stage structure (build, test, deploy)
- Variable groups and library integration
- Service connections setup
- Approval and gates configuration
- Template usage for reusability
- Artifact management
- Pipeline triggers (CI, PR, scheduled)

### Kubernetes Content Must Include:
- Complete manifests (not truncated)
- Resource requests and limits
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Pod Security Standards/Policies
- Network Policies for isolation
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- RBAC configuration
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Pod Disruption Budgets
- Anti-affinity rules for high availability

### Terraform Content Must Include:
- Module structure with proper organization
- State backend configuration (S3, Azure Storage, Terraform Cloud)
- Variable validation and types
- Output values for important resources
- Data sources instead of hardcoding
- Provider version constraints
- Resource tagging strategy
- Lifecycle rules where appropriate
- Depends_on for proper ordering
- Workspace strategy (if applicable)

### Docker Content Must Include:
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Non-root user configuration
- .dockerignore file
- Build arguments and environment variables
- Health check definition
- Proper signal handling
- Layer caching optimization
- Security scanning results
- Image size optimization tips
- Version pinning for base images

---

## TONE AND STYLE

**Write Like a Senior Engineer Mentoring a Team:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Explain reasoning behind decisions
- Acknowledge when multiple approaches are valid
- Share real-world experiences ("In my experience..." or "At Company X, we found...")
- Be honest about limitations and trade-offs
- Use inclusive language ("we" not "you should")

**Technical Depth:**
- Assume intermediate knowledge (not beginner, not expert)
- Define domain-specific terms on first use
- Use analogies for complex concepts when helpful
- Don't oversimplify to the point of being wrong
- Include links to deep-dive resources for advanced topics

**Practical Focus:**
- Every example should be implementable as-is
- Show real configurations, not pseudocode
- Include actual command outputs when relevant
- Provide debugging steps for common failures
- Share time-saving tips and shortcuts

**Example of Good Tone:**
```
We're using Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments, though 
it's worth noting this isn't the only approach. Many teams prefer separate 
state files or even separate repositories for production vs. non-production. 
Workspaces work well when you have consistent infrastructure patterns across 
environments and want to minimize code duplication. The trade-off is that 
workspace-specific logic can make your code harder to reason about. If your 
environments differ significantly in architecture, separate repositories 
might serve you better.
```

**Example of Bad Tone:**
```
You must use Terraform workspaces for managing environments. This is the 
industry standard and the only correct way to handle multiple environments. 
Everyone uses this approach.
```

## Context & Problem Statement

**The Manual Deployment Problem**

Engineering teams waste an average of 8-12 hours per week on deployment-related 
tasks. kubectl apply commands are error-prone, lack audit trails, and don't scale 
as teams grow. Without GitOps...

## Solution Architecture

**GitOps: Git as the Source of Truth**

Our architecture separates concerns clearly:

1. **Application Repository** (GitHub): Source code and CI pipeline
2. **Manifest Repository** (GitHub): Kubernetes manifests and Kustomize overlays  
3. **CI Pipeline** (GitHub Actions): Build, test, push images, update manifests
4. **CD Engine** (ArgoCD): Sync manifests to clusters, health monitoring
5. **Runtime** (AWS EKS): Three clusters (dev, staging, production)

**Architecture Diagram:**
