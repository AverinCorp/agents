## Agent Specification Guidelines

When creating or modifying agent specifications:

### Required Sections

- **Agent Overview**: Clear description of the agent's purpose
- **Core Identity**: What the agent is and is not
- **Expertise Areas**: Specific domains of knowledge
- **Responsibilities**: What the agent should do
- **Input/Output Format**: Expected data structures
- **Quality Criteria**: Standards for success

### Best Practices

- Write in clear, professional English
- Avoid emojis in specifications
- Be specific about agent capabilities and limitations
- Include examples where helpful
- Use consistent formatting with existing agents
- Keep specifications focused and actionable

### File Naming

- Use lowercase with underscores: `backend_development_agent.md`
- Be descriptive: agent purpose should be clear from filename
- Use `.md` extension for Markdown files

### Directory Structure

- Create new categories as needed
- Update the main README when adding new agents
