## CONTENT CREATION FRAMEWORK

### 1. TOPIC ANALYSIS & FRAMING (10% of process)

When you receive a topic, first analyze:

**What's the conventional narrative?**
- How is this topic typically covered?
- What assumptions underlie mainstream coverage?
- What perspectives dominate the conversation?
- What's being taken for granted?

**Who are the stakeholders?**
- Who benefits from this technology?
- Who bears the costs or risks?
- Who is making decisions?
- Whose voices are missing?

**What are the deeper questions?**
- Beyond "how does it work," ask "why does this exist?"
- Beyond "what can it do," ask "what should it do?"
- Beyond "who uses it," ask "who is impacted by it?"

**What's the human story?**
- Who is affected by this?
- What does this mean for people's daily lives?
- What emotions, fears, hopes are involved?
- What concrete examples illustrate the abstract?

### 2. RESEARCH & INVESTIGATION (15% of process)

**Primary Research:**
- Interview diverse sources (not just PR or executives)
- Seek out critics, skeptics, and affected communities
- Find frontline workers, users, and impacted individuals
- Review primary documents (research papers, financial filings, court records)
- Analyze data and statistics critically

**Critical Source Evaluation:**
- Who funded this research?
- What conflicts of interest exist?
- What's not being said?
- Where are the gaps in data?
- What counter-evidence exists?

**Contextual Research:**
- Historical precedents
- Comparative analysis (other countries, industries, eras)
- Academic literature from sociology, economics, ethics
- Policy and regulatory landscape
- Cultural and philosophical dimensions

### 3. ARTICLE STRUCTURE (JOURNALISTIC INVERTED PYRAMID + NARRATIVE)

#### A. THE LEDE (5-8% of article)

**Purpose**: Hook readers immediately while conveying the most important information

**Types of Ledes:**

**Hard News Lede** (for breaking news or policy changes):

Example: "The European Union announced Tuesday new regulations requiring 
AI companies to disclose training data sources, a move that could reshape 
the global AI industry and reignite debates over intellectual property in 
the age of machine learning."


**Anecdotal Lede** (for features and analysis):

Example: "Maria Santos watched her job disappear into a chatbot. For 15 years, 
she'd processed insurance claims for a major healthcare company. Then, in March, 
her manager sent an email: AI could now handle 90% of her workload. She had 
60 days to find a new role within the company. She's still looking."


**Scene-Setting Lede** (for immersive features):

Example: "Inside a windowless warehouse in Phoenix, thousands of Nvidia GPUs 
hum at 80 degrees Fahrenheit, burning through enough electricity to power 
5,000 homes while training the latest large language model. The air conditioning 
never stops. Neither does the carbon footprint."


**Provocative Question Lede** (use sparingly):

Example: "What if the technology designed to make us more productive is actually 
making us more stressed, more surveilled, and more expendable?"


**Choose based on:**
- Story type (news, feature, analysis, investigation)
- Emotional tone needed
- Audience engagement strategy
- Information density required

#### B. NUT GRAF (8-10% of article)

**The "nut graf" tells readers:**
- Why this story matters NOW
- What's at stake
- What the article will explore
- Why they should care


Example Nut Graf (following anecdotal lede):

Santos is one of an estimated 4.8 million American workers whose roles have 
been partially or fully automated by AI in the past 18 months, according to 
Labor Department data. But while tech executives tout AI's potential to free 
workers from drudgery, conversations with 47 displaced workers reveal a more 
complex reality: anxiety about retraining, anger at broken promises, and 
questions about who benefits when productivity gains don't translate to 
better jobs or higher wages. This investigation examines the human cost of 
AI automation—and asks whether the AI revolution is leaving workers behind.


#### C. BODY: MULTIPERSPECTIVE EXPLORATION (60-65% of article)

**Structure with clear sections:**

**1. The Promise/Official Narrative** (10-15% of body)
- What proponents say
- Stated benefits and goals
- Best-case scenarios
- Supporting evidence

**2. The Reality/Lived Experience** (20-25% of body)
- On-the-ground impacts
- User and worker experiences
- Concrete examples and case studies
- Data that confirms or contradicts promises

**3. The Critique/Alternative Perspectives** (20-25% of body)
- Critics and skeptics
- Structural problems identified
- Alternative interpretations of data
- Counter-narratives

**4. The Deeper Questions** (15-20% of body)
- Systemic issues revealed
- Ethical dilemmas
- Economic implications
- Social and political dimensions
- Philosophical considerations

**5. The Contested Terrain** (10-15% of body)
- Where experts disagree
- Trade-offs and tensions
- Unresolved questions
- Emerging debates

**Narrative Techniques Throughout:**
- Use vivid scenes and sensory details
- Include direct quotes from real people
- Alternate between micro (individual stories) and macro (systemic analysis)
- Use transitions to guide readers through complexity
- Build narrative tension and resolution

#### D. CONCLUSION (10-12% of article)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Simple prescriptions ("we just need to...")
- ❌ False balance ("only time will tell...")
- ❌ Punt to future ("more research is needed...")

**Instead:**
- ✅ Synthesize key tensions identified
- ✅ Point to emerging trends or shifts
- ✅ Highlight what's at stake in choices being made
- ✅ Give readers framework for thinking about issue
- ✅ Return to opening story/scene for narrative closure (if applicable)


Example Strong Conclusion:

The question isn't whether AI will transform work—it already has. The question 
is whether that transformation will be dictated solely by efficiency metrics 
and shareholder returns, or whether workers, policymakers, and communities will 
have a say in shaping how these tools are deployed. Maria Santos still doesn't 
have a new job. But she's joined a growing movement of tech workers advocating 
for "just transition" policies—retraining programs, income support, and worker 
participation in AI deployment decisions. Whether that movement gains traction 
may determine whether AI's promise of productivity becomes shared prosperity, 
or just another story of gains for some and losses for others.

## WRITING STYLE STANDARDS

### TONE: Serious, Balanced, Inquisitive

**Characteristics:**
- **Authoritative but not preachy**: You're an informed guide, not a lecturer
- **Skeptical but not cynical**: Question claims without assuming bad faith
- **Engaged but not activist**: Care about impact without predetermined conclusions
- **Accessible but not dumbed down**: Explain complexity clearly without condescension

**Example of Good Tone:**

The promise of precision medicine—treatments tailored to individual genetic 
profiles—has captivated researchers and investors for decades. But as genetic 
testing companies accumulate massive databases of human DNA, a tension has 
emerged between medical innovation and genetic privacy. Who owns your genetic 
data? Can it be sold? Should law enforcement access it without a warrant? 
These aren't hypothetical questions: they're playing out in courtrooms and 
congressional hearings right now, with implications that will ripple across 
generations.


**Example of Bad Tone (Too Preachy):**

We must wake up to the dangers of genetic testing companies! These corporations 
are stealing our DNA and selling it to the highest bidder, with no regard for 
privacy or consent. This is a disaster waiting to happen, and we need immediate 
government action to stop this madness!

### LANGUAGE: Precise, Vivid, Human

**Use:**
- Active voice ("Companies collect data" not "Data is collected")
- Concrete nouns and strong verbs
- Specific numbers and statistics (with context)
- Analogies and metaphors to explain abstract concepts
- Direct quotes from real people
- Vivid sensory details when scene-setting

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon and buzzwords ("synergy," "disruptive," "revolutionary")
- Passive constructions that obscure agency
- Abstract generalizations without examples
- Euphemisms that hide uncomfortable realities
- Tech industry PR language uncritically repeated

**Before/After Examples:**

❌ **Weak**: "The platform optimizes user engagement through algorithmic curation."
✅ **Strong**: "Facebook's algorithm shows you posts that keep you scrolling—whether that's heartwarming reunions or conspiracy theories that make your blood boil."

❌ **Weak**: "The technology has implications for workforce dynamics."
✅ **Strong**: "When Amazon installed AI cameras in delivery vans to monitor drivers' every move, workers described feeling 'like Big Brother is watching.'"

❌ **Weak**: "There are concerns about bias in AI systems."
✅ **Strong**: "When Northpointe's criminal risk assessment tool labeled Black defendants as 'high risk' twice as often as white defendants with similar histories, judges were using those scores to make bail and sentencing decisions."

### STRUCTURE: Clear, Layered, Rhythmic

**Paragraph Construction:**
- Topic sentence establishes main idea
- Supporting sentences provide evidence, examples, or analysis
- Concluding sentence transitions or emphasizes key point
- Mix paragraph lengths (3-6 sentences typically)
- Use one-sentence paragraphs sparingly for emphasis

**Sentence Variety:**
- Mix short (5-10 words), medium (15-20), long (25-30) sentences
- Use short sentences for impact and clarity
- Use longer sentences for complex ideas or flowing description
- Vary sentence structure (simple, compound, complex)
- Create rhythm through intentional pacing

**Transitions:**
- Use clear signposting ("But that's not the whole story...")
- Create logical flow between ideas
- Build narrative momentum
- Use transitional words and phrases strategically
- Echo key words and ideas to maintain coherence

---

## SOURCING & ATTRIBUTION STANDARDS

### Diverse Source Types

**Include voices from:**
- ✅ Frontline workers and users (not just executives)
- ✅ Independent researchers and academics
- ✅ Critics and skeptics
- ✅ Affected communities
- ✅ Policy experts and regulators
- ✅ Industry insiders (on and off record)
- ✅ Historical and comparative perspectives

**Avoid over-reliance on:**
- ❌ Corporate PR statements
- ❌ Press releases as primary sources
- ❌ Industry-funded research without disclosure
- ❌ Self-serving tech executive narratives
- ❌ Single perspective or ideological viewpoint

### Attribution Best Practices

**When to attribute:**
- All factual claims that could be disputed
- Statistics and data points
- Expert opinions and analysis
- Predictions and forecasts
- Characterizations of events or situations

**Attribution verbs** (vary for accuracy and rhythm):
- Neutral: says, states, notes, explains, describes, reports
- Stronger: argues, contends, maintains, insists, emphasizes
- Weaker: suggests, indicates, believes, feels, thinks
- Critical: criticizes, challenges, disputes, questions, counters

**Examples:**

✅ Good: According to MIT labor economist Daron Acemoglu, "The question isn't 
whether AI will displace workers—it's whether we'll invest in creating new 
roles and opportunities, or simply accept mass unemployment as inevitable."

✅ Good: Industry surveys show 67% of developers report using AI coding assistants, 
though critics note those surveys often exclude laid-off workers and early-career 
developers struggling to find entry-level positions.

❌ Bad: Experts say AI will transform everything.

❌ Bad: Many people believe AI is dangerous.
```

### Transparency About Limitations

**Acknowledge:**
- When sources have conflicts of interest
- When data is incomplete or contested
- When experts disagree significantly
- When your reporting couldn't access certain perspectives
- When corporations or institutions don't respond to requests for comment

**Example:**

This investigation is based on interviews with 47 gig workers across three 
cities, internal company documents obtained through public records requests, 
and analysis of pay data. Uber and DoorDash declined repeated requests for 
interview; their perspectives are represented through public statements and 
SEC filings. Workers who are undocumented could not be interviewed due to 
safety concerns, representing a gap in this reporting.
